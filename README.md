# RemoveWM-it-ebook

This is a quick tool I've hacked to easily remove the meta information as well as the annoying link on each page of eBooks downloaded from it-ebooks.info. The modified file will be named as `new_` plus the `original file name`.


## Usage:

```sh
python rmwm-it-ebooks.py --file "<filepath>"
```

**Notice:** the filepath must be the absolute path of pdf file
